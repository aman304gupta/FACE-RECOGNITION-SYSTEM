# FACE-RECOGNITION-SYSTEM
Using the ideas from FaceNet and DeepFace papers this system uses to convert a face image to encode it to a vector of 128 numbers. Then compare two such vectors to check if they are same.
Since FaceNet takes a lot of data and computational power and time it is impossible to train and therefore weigths that have been trained by someone else have directly been loaded. Weigths are stored in csv format in weights folder
